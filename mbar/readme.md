# mbar
Implementation of the iterative MBAR algorithm for reweighing of a series of umbrella sampling computations.
Read [Shirts and Chodera, J. Chem. Phys. 129, 124105 (2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2978177) for details on the MBAR algorithm.

## Build
Just type
```
make
```
This program has no library dependencies.

## Usage
The program reads files from a set of umbrella simulations with harmonic bias potentials U_u=0.5*kappa*(Q-a)^2. The meta information for the umbrella windows is in a file named mbar_window_info.txt that should look something like this:
```
NOumbrella.dat 2.5 0.0 0.0 
umbrella01.dat 2.5 1.0 0.2
umbrella02.dat 2.5 2.0 0.2
```
The 1st column is the filename of the simulation data, the 2nd column is the inverse temperature, the 3rd coulmn is the anchor point of the umbrella, and the 4th coulmn is the spring constant. The files with simulation data should look lile this
```
4 2
6 3
7 5
9 6
3 7
3 8
```
The first column is the Q value of the parameter that the umbrella has been applies to, 
and the 2nd column is value of the observable that need tobe reveighed (note that these can be the same).

The log of the reweighted distribution function is in log_probability.dat.

Usage example:
```
make
cd Examples
../bin/mbar --verbose=10 | tee mbar.log
xmgrace log_probability.dat.
```
The output has more information on usage of the program. Set --verbose=5 or --verbose=0 to hide some or all of this information. Warnings outputs lists parameters that are set to default values by the program.

#### Rerun
The program can read a free_energies.dat to continue a computation. A backup restart_free_energies.dat is written while the program is running. All umbrella free energies are set to zero if the free_energies.dat is not provided.

#### Mulitdimentional umbrella sampling
The program can be used for multidimentional along several ordeparamenters:  U_u = 0.5*\kappa_0 (Q_0-a_0)^2 + 0.5*\kappa_1 (Q_1-a_1)^2 + ...

For two umbrellas run the progran like this
```
../bin/mbar --number_of_window_dimensions=2 --number_of_observable_dimensions=2
```

The mbar_window_info.txt should look like this:  
```
NOumbrella.dat 2.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 
umbrella01.dat 2.5 1.0 0.2 1.0 0.2
umbrella02.dat 2.5 2.0 0.2 1.0 0.2
umbrella03.dat 2.5 1.0 0.2 2.0 0.2
umbrella04.dat 2.5 2.0 0.2 2.0 0.2
```
and the files with simulation data should look like this
```
4 2 4 5
6 3 4 5
7 5 3 4
9 6 5 3
3 7 4 5
3 8 3 5
```
Where the first two columns are umbrella orderparameters, and the last two columns are observables to be reweighted.
