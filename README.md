# URPTools
This is a bunch of stand-alone (linux) tools that I during the years have made for numerical computations in the field of condensed matter physics/chemistry. Feel free to use the programs, and write me for bugs, suggestions or questions (e-mail: ulf AT urp.dk). I would also be happy to hear if you make use of these programs.
